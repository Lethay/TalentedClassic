--How to acquire these?
-- Play each class in turn -- and get a pet of each kind on a hunter -- and run
	-- /script Talented:PrintSortedWoWIndices()
-- That will produce the indices.
-- You may also need to get the spellIDs and put them into spelldata.lua. The easiest way is to look at the page source of the list of abilities in WoWHead (e.g. view-source:https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spells/pet-abilities/hunter/generic#0+1+20 ) and map the names to the IDs with some code.
