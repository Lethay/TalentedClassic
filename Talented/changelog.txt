v191007
    - Untested fix to learning talents when "Confirm learn" is on (why did no-one mention this bug before?)
    
v191004
    - Fix Wowhead importing again (now accepts URLs with a talent input order in)
    - Fix "apply" button; now uses old algorithm of applying a talent point after CHARACTER_POINTS_CHANGED fires, as apparently the vanilla API doesn't return quick enough
    - Add notes about localisation for those languages that are missing it
    - Remove code and references to inspecting characters
    - Fix validation checks - no longer can one remove the entire top row of talents because they're bad (hi Disc Priests)
    - Fix name of Arcane Power in korean localisation
