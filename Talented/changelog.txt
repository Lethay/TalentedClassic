v191026
    - Found yet another exception for WoWHead importing, now fixed
    
v191014
    - Upgrade Talented_Data to Ace3 (because why not, apparently) - thanks to @deathcore01
    - Add German localisation to talent tooltips - thanks to @deathcore01
    - Update to korean localisation - thanks to @chkmyid
    - Update to russian localisation
 
v191011
    - Potential stop to LibGratuity interacting with other addons, by disabling AceAddon 2 support. But maybe it doesn't work - we'll see!
    - Minor update to localisation, so that errors don't fire in other clients when Talented_Data is missing (though sometimes English text is shown)
 
v191010
    - Add Taiwanese (i.e. traditional Chinese script) localisation to tooltips, with thanks to @Class2u
    - Add Chinese (i.e. simplified Chinese script) localisation to tooltips, with thanks to @rainyr
 
v191007
    - Untested fix to learning talents when "Confirm learn" is on (why did no-one mention this bug before?)
    
v191004
    - Fix Wowhead importing again (now accepts URLs with a talent input order in)
    - Fix "apply" button; now uses old algorithm of applying a talent point after CHARACTER_POINTS_CHANGED fires, as apparently the vanilla API doesn't return quick enough
    - Add notes about localisation for those languages that are missing it
    - Remove code and references to inspecting characters
    - Fix validation checks - no longer can one remove the entire top row of talents because they're bad (hi Disc Priests)
    - Fix name of Arcane Power in korean localisation
    
v190928
    - Fix Wowhead importing
    - Add Russian localisation to tooltips (thanks to @tierggg)
 
v190927
    - Fixed reaction to resetting talents (thanks to @deathcore01)
    - Made Talented_Data depend on Talented
 
v190926
    - Fixed/added the ability to show a target template when choosing talents
    - Add korean localisation to tooltips (with thanks to @chkmyid)
    
v190924
    - Removed references to "Glyph" in code (and options menu!)
    - Removed mmochamp.lua and spellData.lua from Talented.toc
    - Fixed tooltips to show ranks>1
    - Fixed detection of when Talented_Data is disabled
    - Removed debug printing from Wowhead export
    - Fixed display of talent prerequisites
    - Prevent blocking of talent reset -- this issue is not yet fixed, as Talented will not respond to reset talents without a reload
