# TalentedClassic
WoW addon. A replacement to the default talent UI that allows creation of templates and viewing of all trees at once.

Talented, Talented_GlyphFrame and Talented_SpecTabs are all required for proper usage. The legacy Talented_Data folder is no longer required.

This was an addon originally written by "Jerry" (URL: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12593-Talented.html). The project is since abandoned, so I adapted old code to form this version.

**Feature List (adapted from original page)**

    See the complete talent tree on a single frame.
    Create and view templates for all classes.
    Apply complete templates with a single click, after a talent wipe.
    Share your current build with others, or any template you've made.
    Import and export templates directly from Wowhead.
    A macro command /talented apply <template> allows automatic application of a template based on its name.

**Known issues and planned fixes**

    Hunter pet talents do not work
    Potential issues with importing talent builds from Wowhead.
    Talent templates take time to be applied and sometimes crash
    Name of new glyph is not given when replacing a glyph
    Templates cannot target secondary spec
    Glyph pane does not default to secondary spec when that is active
