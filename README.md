# TalentedClassic
WoW addon. A replacement to the default talent UI that allows creation of templates and viewing of all trees at once.

Talented, Talented_GlyphFrame and Talented_SpecTabs are all required for proper usage. The legacy Talented_Data folder is no longer required.

This was an addon originally written by "Jerry" (URL: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12593-Talented.html). The project is since abandoned, so I adapted old code to form this version.

Feature List (adapted from original page)

    See the complete talent tree on a single frame.
    Create and view templates for all classes.
    Apply complete templates with a single click, after a talent wipe.
    Share your current build with others, or any template you've made.
    Import and export templates directly from Wowhead.
    A macro command /talented apply <template> allows automatic application of a template based on its name.

Known issues

    Cannot replace glyphs.
    Cannot set role for the group finder.
    Pet talents do not work.
    Potential issues with importing talent builds from Wowhead.
